Purpose:

conseqPattMining_Day.py means get all the PM2.5 level data of the past 24 hours 
and use these data for consequent pattern mining .
We applied Hill Function to generate the corresponding weight for patterns of each length,
then multiply the corresponding weight with the frequency of each pattern to rise the 
influence of the patterns of longer length and reduce that of the patterns of shorter length.

Execution :
'''
	python conseqPattMining_Day.py

'''
Enter airbox / lass and device ID to use the PM2.5 data of that device for pattern mining.
e.g. airbox 74DA3895C39E

Output:
It will output the candidate pattern for prediction according to the Device ID you entered.
e.g. if you enter "airbox 74DA3895C39E"
The output will be something like:
"candidatePredictionPatts of Device :74DA3895C39E  is  [('aa', 0.21951219512195122), ('ab', 0.03658536585365854)]"
