## Abstract

LASS project is going to collect the PM2.5 data from PM2.5 detecting equipments and forecast the PM2.5 via all data we collecting. In addition, using data visualization to demostrate the PM2.5 data.

This project is going to collect the PM2.5 data from PM2.5 detecting equipments such as *AirBiox*. By analyzing PM2.5 data, we propose a predicted algorithm to forecast the PM2.5 via all data we collecting. Moreover, we also visualize the PM2.5 data in the website.
